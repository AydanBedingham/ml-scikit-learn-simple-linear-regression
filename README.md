# Scikit-Learn Simple Linear Regression

Jupyter Notebook that uses Scikit-Learn to train a machine learning model to perform simple linear regression on a fuel consumption dataset. The fuel consumption dataset lists automobile Horse Power and Fuel Economy data.

* Import fuel consumption dataset
* Visualize the dataset using Seaborn and MatplotLib
* Seperate dataset into training data and test data
* Train a Linear Regression model using training data
* Test the model
